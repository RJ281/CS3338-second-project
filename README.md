# CS3338 Second Project

This repository contains my work for the CS3338 Software Engineering Tools second assignment. It demonstrates:

- Forking and cloning a repository
- Branch creation and editing workflow
- Filling in project information in index.html
- Creating and merging pull requests
- Maintaining a clean repo with a README file
